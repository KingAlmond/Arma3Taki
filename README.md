# Arma3Taki
A modification for Arma 3 - RPG gamemode on Takistan.

------------------
This project is built on the framework Altis Life RPG by Tonic and editted by KingAlmond & Coyn for STD's Arma 3 Takistan Life. Project work contains edits from various authors including but not limited to Listek & Kraken. Note: These are snippets from the entire project.
------------------


**Purpose:**

To bring Altis Life RPG to a famous map on Arma 3 called "Takistan". We updated the original framework to work with the current version of the game (at the time Arma 3 1.64). Further, we introduced more functionality into the RPG framework such as keycards, persistence and GPS tracking.

**Techinical Info:**

1) Server_Files_Core -- contains critical server files that communicate with the client, dedicated server and the extDB(SQL database).

2) Scripts -- contains core .sqf files to allow direct server & client communication. This file also allows the client to communicate with 'modifications' to the original Arma 3 base game.
